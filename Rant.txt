It was a calm Sunday evening.

I had woken up late, after an extended restful sleep. The day so far had gone well and I felt like
I was on top the world. Come the sixth hour I had started work upon the long and arduous process of
creating a UML class diagram. Whilst sipping on the warm tea I had made earlier, I pondered the
choices I was to make. It took mere minutes to formulate a plan worthy of a nubian architect.
I would relish the maple syrup and buttered toast as I carefully crafted the finest UML in all
the lands.

As expected my plan was executed flawlessly, toast was devoured, classes had been created through
sheer strokes of genius. I witnessed the creation of a beautiful and expansive world right in front
of my eyes. The vibrant colours of both the extensibility and adherence to SOLID within this
diagram lead to an intense moment of pure emotion.

I saw it, I saw what heaven was. To see the fruits of creation come to life, to witness the map
factory, so formidable yet open to extension. I yelled "Eureka!" and flung my body around the
room in ecstasy. All the pains and sore had been banished.

To stop at this point would have been madness, to throw away a grasp at omniscience if you will.
I needed more, to the point where I could discern the difference between real life and UML...

Alas it all ended. I witnessed heaven and the I witness the hell (AKA gliffy.com). In my frenzied
state to produce the greatest diagram that man kind had ever seen I pulled in another aggregation
link, to add to the myriad of existing ones. It was too much for one browser to handle. My hands
trembled, my mind was trying to comprehend the situation. Bulging, pulsing, the pain of all the
men who died within the last century returned to cast their misery upon me. I was being tormented
with foul injustice of a world of error.
